<!-- so we seen how just adding an input text with the right ng-model and two braces makes the field go populated: how is working? -->
<body ng-app="mainApp" ng-controller="app">
<input type="text" ng-model="myText" />
<br/>Textfield updated {{counter}} times
	{{myText}} 
	<!-- the var inside is registered in the digest cycle and check for, in this case, ng-model="myText"-->
	<!-- $scope.watch() allows us to customise the take over of the variable by angular-->
	
	<!-- in example know how many times the text box has been modified -->
