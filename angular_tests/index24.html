<!-- Services and factories will allow you to have data in different controllers - like an array of employees; having multiple requests is not practical, rather would be nice to have a single http request and handle that one alone; that is waht services are for -technically singleton, only one istance is created and a reference is passed -->

<!-- Just as services, factories are singletons so they will return the same value from random number - how (if we want to) fix that? -->
